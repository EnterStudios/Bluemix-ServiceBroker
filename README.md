# Overview
In this "How to" I am going to explain the steps to register your own Service Broker on Bluemix Public, Dedicated and Local. Service Brokers are one option to extend Cloud Foundry using your own functionality and to integrate existing (on-premises or cloud) infrastructure and services.

# Bluemix Public vs. Bluemix Dedicated and Bluemix Local
[IBM Bluemix allows to run applications on Cloud Foundry](https://console.eu-gb.bluemix.net/docs/overview/whatisbluemix.html). It comes in three flavors: Bluemix Public provides a shared cloud infrastructure whereas Bluemix Dedicated is a customer-specifc dedicated cloud. Lastly, Bluemix Local is a private cloud in the customer data center. Because of the delivery model the individual user privileges differ which may impact what kind of service brokers can be added to Bluemix.
